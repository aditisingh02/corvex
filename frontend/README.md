# Corvex HR Management System

Corvex is a comprehensive HR Management System built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). It is designed to help companies efficiently manage employee data, attendance, leave requests, and departmental organization, with robust role-based access for administrators, HR personnel, and employees.

## Project Overview

This system streamlines HR operations by providing:

- **User Authentication & Role-Based Authorization:** Secure access for admins, HR, and employees, ensuring data privacy and appropriate permissions.
- **Employee Management:** Centralized handling of personal and professional employee details.
- **Department Management:** Organization of staff into departments for effective management.
- **Attendance Management:** Tracking of employee check-in and check-out times.
- **Leave Management:** Employees can apply for leave, and HR can review and process requests.
- **Role-Specific Dashboards:** Tailored dashboards for reporting and analytics based on user roles.

The backend is implemented as a RESTful API using Node.js and Express.js, interfacing with a MongoDB database. The frontend is developed with React, offering a responsive and user-friendly interface.
